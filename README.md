# LSTM-SWIFTUI - SwiftUI implementation of a LSTM

This repository contains a SWIFTUI implementation of a LSTM. This is the baseline Machine Learning algorithm used in the Skitag App. It differs in terms of optimization from the one that is installed in the latest version of Skitag. We publish this algorithm with the intention to share this library to anyone who has curiosity about both SWIFTUI and LSTM, and we do it also to be compliant with Skitag's AI Ethics commitment to transparency.
